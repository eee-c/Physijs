# This Fork

I'm using Physi.js as the physics engine in [3D Game Programming for Kids, 2nd ed](https://pragprog.com/book/csjava/3d-game-programming-for-kids). This fork catalogs the changes that I needed to get working with ammo.js in August 2017.

Development on Physi.js is idle. I'm not trying to resolve all problems -- just enough for it to work in the book examples.
